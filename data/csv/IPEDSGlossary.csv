"Carnegie Classification 2005: Basic classification","The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 to support its research program, and later published in 1973 for use by other researchers. Although this classification has undergone many changes over the years, the current release involves some significant changes from previous editions.

"Carnegie Classification 2005: Enrollment profile classification","This classification describes the overall student population, by grouping institutions according to the mix of students enrolled at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels. Exclusively undergraduate institutions are further broken down by level (two-year and four-year). For institutions with both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, institutions are grouped according to the distribution of full-time equivalent students across the two levels, giving an approximate measure of the student population's 'center of gravity.' As a result, it reflects important differences with respect to educational mission as well as institutional climate and culture-differences that can have implications for infrastructure, services, and resource allocation.  For a complete description and technical details visit the Carnegie Foundation Website at http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications",""
"Carnegie Classification 2005: Graduate instructional program","As a companion to the Undergraduate Instructional Program classification, this classification examines the nature of graduate education, with a special focus on the mix of graduate programs. In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusion.The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded master's/professional or doctoral), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that do not award the doctorate, and one for doctoral-level institutions (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, institutions are then classified with respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.

"Carnegie Classification 2005: Undergraduate instructional program","The instructional program classification is based on three pieces of information: the level of undergraduate degrees awarded (associate's or bachelor's), the proportion of bachelor's degree majors in the arts and sciences and in professional fields, and the extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it awards undergraduate degrees. The distinction between arts and sciences and professional undergraduate majors is one that has been made in the Classification since 1987 (but only for undergraduate colleges), and researchers and others in the higher education community have made similar distinctions. The previous analysis has been extended and elaborated by (1) applying it to almost all baccalaureate-level institutions, (2) making finer distinctions along the arts and sciences - professions continuum, and (3) recognizing a 'middle ground' where the two domains exist in relative balance with respect to graduating students' major concentrations.

"Carnegie Classification 2005: Undergraduate profile","This classification describes the undergraduate population with respect to three characteristics: the proportion who attend part- or full-time; achievement characteristics of first-year students; and the proportion of entering students who transfer in from another institution. Each of these captures important differences in the nature of the undergraduate population. They do not imply differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but they have implications for how an institution serves its students.
